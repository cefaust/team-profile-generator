# Team profile generator

### Description

With this project I was tasked with creating a commandline application that takes in information about employees. It
will then generate an HTML webpage that will display the summaries for each person.

### Things I included in this project

1. The project in includes inquirer to prompt user for information.
2. The given information will create an HTML page that displays a nicely formatted roster based on the user in put.
3. When the user clicks on email address it will open the default users email client to email to that email address.
4. When the user clicks on the GitHub username it will open a new tab that takes the user to GitHub
5. When prompting for information every employee will have a name, email, ID, and role.
6. Based on which role selected there will be a role specific question:
    1. For a Manager it will ask the office number for the manager.
    2. For an Engineer it will ask the GitHub username.
    3. For an Intern it will ask the intern's school attended.
7. When the user is finished building the team there will be an option to finish. Then it will build the HTML page.
